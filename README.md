# Intro to Programming and Starting a Personal Project Workshop

Welcome to our first workshop of the year! We'll be focusing on two main topics today:

1. **[Starting a Personal Project](StartingAPersonalProject.md)** - You don't need to know how to program to start thinking about what you'd like to build! Let's find out how, and come up with a personal project.
1. **Intro to Programming** - Before we dive into the specifics of certain languages and technologies work this semester, it'd be good to understand better how to work with our computer through the terminal and by using version control.
    * [Using the Terminal](UsingTheTerminal.md)
    * [Version Control](VersionControl.md)
