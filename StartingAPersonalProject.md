# Starting a Personal Project

Personal projects are huge for CS careers -- when you don't have much on your resume, personal projects can help you out immeasurably by:

* Filling out the empty space
* Showing employers that you...
  * Know how to solve complex problems
  * Can learn new technologies readily
  * Have experience with tech they use regularly

To help with the development process, we've broken it down into many pieces:

1. **Choosing an Idea**
   * [**Bringing an Idea to Life**](https://github.com/HackBinghamton/IntroToProgrammingWorkshop/blob/master/IdeaToProject.md) - Deriving ideas from real-world problems.
   * [**Project-Based Learning**](ProjectBasedLearning.md) - Designing projects in order to learn about new topics.
2. [**Fleshing out the Details**](https://github.com/HackBinghamton/IntroToProgrammingWorkshop/blob/master/FleshingOutTheDetails.md) - Using Acceptance Criteria, Minimum Viable Product, and Agile to organize and manage your idea.
3. [**Choosing Your Tech Stack and Prototyping**](https://github.com/HackBinghamton/IntroToProgrammingWorkshop/blob/master/ChoosingTechnologiesAndPrototyping.md) - Picking the right tools for the job and starting to outline your project.
4. [**Clean Code**](https://github.com/HackBinghamton/IntroToProgrammingWorkshop/blob/master/CleanCode.md) - Making your code easier to work with for yourself and others.
